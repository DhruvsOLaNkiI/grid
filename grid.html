<p class="lines">Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</p>

        <h1 id="universe">INFINITE UNIVERSE THEORY

        </h1>
    <p id="pgap">
                Scientific Discipline: Cosmology
        
        One of the major theories of cosmology — the study of space — is that the universe we live in might not have an endpoint, but instead goes on forever. Scientists theorize it’s possible that if you flew a spaceship trying to reach the end of the universe, it would continue to fly past suns and moons and planets and black holes forever. Not everyone agrees with this idea.
        
        The multiverse theory, advanced by other scientists and physicists, says the spaceship would eventually reach the end of our universe, and then transition into another universe — and then another and another and another, for an infinite amount of time.
        
        If either of these theories is true, the infinite nature of space, combined with the limited way that particles can organize themselves to form matter (which planets and life forms are all made out of), leads to a shocking but inevitable truth: Earth as we know it probably repeats itself, over and over.</p>
    <BR><P id="pgap">
        Unfortunately, we can never know for sure if this theory is true, because it’s impossible to observe it. The Earth replicas would be so far away that light coming from them would take longer to reach us then the current age of our universe. Add to that the fact that the universe is constantly expanding — meaning the Earth replicas are constantly getting further and further away — and not only could we never see them, we could also never travel to them even with the most advanced futuristic technology.
    </P><BR>
    <p id="pgap">The theory of Many Worlds is the most similar to the circumstances described in Counterpart, and it’s also the most likely to be true, based on experimental evidence. It goes like this: When particles are teeny tiny (smaller than atoms) they act really, really weird. An electron, for example, is always spinning. When you observe it, you can see that it’s spinning either clockwise or counterclockwise. But before you looked at that electron, when it wasn’t being observed, it was very likely spinning in both directions. You may know this better as Schrödinger’s cat, the theoretical parable that says if you have a cat in a box, the cat is both alive and dead until you open the box, at which point the cat must be one or the other but not both.</p>
    <p id="pgap">In Possible Worlds they’re all there, but they don’t talk to each other, they don’t bump into each other, and you can’t interact with them in any way,” he explains. Of course, unlike physics and cosmology, philosophy doesn’t need any math, or observation to back any of this theorizing up. “Honestly, I think it’s kind of silly,” says Carroll. “But it’s a great thought experiment.”

        In the end, there’s little that scientists can do to prove any one of these hypotheses—ultimately our wildest imaginings could be true. We’ll never know for sure. The good news is you can actually follow one scenario of alternate Earth as it plays out in Counterpart on STARZ starting January 21st. Just remember that, as the Many Worlds theory is likely true, the very act of observing Counterpart means you’ll be creating yet another Earth.</p>
